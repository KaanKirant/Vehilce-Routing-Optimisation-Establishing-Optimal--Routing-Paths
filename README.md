# Vehilce Routing Optimisation - Establishing Optimal Routing Paths
Implemented Dijkstra Algrithm, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimisation Algoritihm on Python. The car dataset ah coordinates of the cars. This dataset was implemented as a weighted graph and the algorithms applied on this graph. The weights are the transmission connection between the cars.
